# A Python based interface to automate data entry in the online Cool Farm Tool (CFT)
This script sequentially retrieves data for each assessment from the Excel sheet, adhering to the tab order in the online CFT, 
and enters the data into the corresponding sections of each tab. It then extracts the final results to integrate with each 
assessment. This process reduces data entry time by 94 % with 100 % accuracy.
